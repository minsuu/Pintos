Pintos Projects
===============

The [UCB CS162](https://cs162.eecs.berkeley.edu/) course Operating Systems and Systems Programming
include projects which is based on the Pintos.

Pintos is a mini OS like MIT's xv6.

Pintos is a simple operating system framework for the 80x86 architecture. It supports kernel threads, loading and running user programs, and a file system, but it implements all of these in a very simple way.

In the Pintos projects, you and your project team will strengthen its support in all three of these areas. You will also add a virtual memory implementation. 

This repository record my procedure of accomplishing these projects.
